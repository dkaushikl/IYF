                    Yoga is not merely for our bodies, but rather Yoga is for our bodies, minds, hearts and souls. Yoga
                    literally means “Union” – union of breath with the body, union of the mind with the muscles, and
                    most
                    importantly union of the self with the divine. Yoga is not a religon. It does not require you to
                    believe in a certain God or chant certain mantras.

                    Yoga is an ancient science which leads to health in the body, peace in the mind, joy in the heart,
                    and
                    liberation of the soul.
